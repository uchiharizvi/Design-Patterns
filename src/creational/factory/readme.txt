Factory Design Pattern
Notes:
1) Create a Product Interface responsible to return the object created
2) Create Concrete impl for product called Concrete Products implementing Product
3) Create Factory(Creator-abstract class ) responsible for invoking the products
4) Create Concrete factory and associate with Concrete product
5) Create Client code to invoke the concrete factories
